## Please refer below link to read Chapter 1: "The Machine Learning Landscape " 
*This is Supplement material for studying.*

Last year, CJ read Chapter 1 and proceeded to research projects as well as expand reading related articles. For teaching, I read it fully again this semester. Although much clearer than before, there are still many questions that are not clear. newbies as you without a prerequisite background, a thorough understanding of Chapter 1 should be difficult because it involves almost a complete scope of the Machine Learning paradigm. You can read it once in the order of paragraphs, marking those topics interesting or with difficulties. Then，the second reading will accompany with expansion from the content of related websites based on the existing themes. Don't try to pursue a detailed understanding, and don't consume much energy involving the reference materials cited by the author.

去年，CJ就閱讀了第1章，並進行了研究項及擴大地閱讀相關文章。為了教學，CJ本學期再次閱讀了完整的內容;儘管比以前清楚了很多，但仍有許多問題尚不清楚。沒有先修課程的新手，要全面了解第1章應該很困難，因為它幾乎涵蓋了機器學習範式的全部範圍。 您可以按段落順序閱讀一次，將那些主題標記為有趣或困難。 然後，根據現有主題從相關網站的內容開始進行二讀。 不要試圖尋求詳細的理解，也不要消耗大量的精力涉及作者引用的參考資料。從第二章開始將繼續探討相關的主題，因此請放心。
